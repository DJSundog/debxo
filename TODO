roadmap
-------

0.5
  * automatically start X for desktops that don't have a display manager; that
    is, !gnome and !kde.  http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=49160
    is a good starting point, if we want to do it via inittab.
  * hal - HAL gets info from ACPI, APM, or OFW.  Our OFW is
    not standard, so HAL doesn't get the proper information (thus gnome's
    power manager doesn't support suspend-on-lid-close, for example).  This
    needs to be done; a combination of getting promfs kernel stuff upstream,
    standardizing on location, and getting HAL updated to use new paths.
  * power management - pm-utils does stupid stuff like switching away from 
    X before suspend.  It shouldn't do this.  It should, however, disable
    wlan and tell the dcon to sleep during suspend.
      echo 0 > /sys/power/wlan-enabled;
      echo 1 >  /sys/devices/platform/dcon/sleep
  * unionfs for ext3 images - Mitch has proposed a scheme similar to
    puppy linux and various livecd images that would allow us to copy images
    onto an SD or USB stick without destroying the partition table or the
    filesystem.
    fedora's livecd stuff - http://git.fedoraproject.org/git/?p=hosted/livecd;a=tree

0.6+
  * what's up with ekiga?  gst works for capturing video, why doesn't ekiga?

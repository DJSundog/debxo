xodist - Debian image builder for OLPC XO

Why is this needed?  Because the OLPC XO has exceptional and flexible
firmware support unlike an ordinary PC.  The usual Debian boot CDs do
not work, yet.  xodist builds a Debian system image in the format
required by the firmware.

See *.packages for other image flavours, and change "kde" below to the
flavour.  See README.approx before starting if you would like to cache
the packages downloaded.

How to use xodist to generate a Debian KDE image for an OLPC XO:

1.  build the root filesystem,

	sudo ./initchroot.sh --package-list kde.packages kde.root

2.  make the JFFS2 filesystem,

	sudo ./mkjffs2.sh kde.root kde.img

3.  copy the files to a thumb drive,

	sudo ./mkbootable.sh --output /mnt kde

4.  ensure the XO is unlocked, by obtaining a Developer Key, and using
the OpenFirmware command,

	disable-security

5.  shut down the XO,

6.  insert the thumb drive,

7.  power up, when prompted press Enter, and the image will be copied
to the NAND flash, and then booted,

Warning: this erases everything on the XO, including any Developer
Key, but if you have followed step 4 above that should not matter so
much.

8.  remove the thumb drive before the next reboot or power up.

Note: Firmware Q2E20 or newer is required. The jffs2 images are for
installation on NAND (the onboard flash), the ext3 images are only for
usbsticks and sd-cards.
